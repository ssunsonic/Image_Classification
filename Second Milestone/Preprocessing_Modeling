1. Finish major preprocessing
     a. For tabular data, this includes scaling and/or transforming your data, imputing your data, encoding your data, feature expansion, Feature expansion (example is taking features and generating new features by transforming via polynomial, log multiplication of features).

     b. For image data this includes scaling the number of pixels from HD to SD i.e. down sampling (1280x720x3RGB to 640x360x3RGB or further). This also includes flattening your image like we did in HW2 64x64 to 4096 x 3RGB so 12888. Another option is transforming RGB to gray scale. Examples of preprocessing and training: (basicLinks to an external site., CCN'sLinks to an external site., another example with data augmentationLinks to an external site., another data augmentation augmentationLinks to an external site..

2. Train your first model

3. Evaluate your model compare training vs test error

4. Where does your model fit in the fitting graph.

5. Update your readme with this info added to the readme with links to the jupyter notebook!
